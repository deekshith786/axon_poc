1. Controller will have the REST APIs.
2. The controller will create and send a particular command to the command gateway.
3. Now, we need to Aggregate for it.
4. The Aggregate will handle the command which is being sent to it.
5. The Aggregate will identify our command as we added the "TargetAggregateIdentifier" annotation.
6. For Aggregate we should add @AggregateIdentifier.
7. Now, for the Aggregate to work, we should have a default constructor and a defined constructor which takes the specific command.
8. In the defined constructor we can write our Business-Logic.
9. After writing our logic, we need to raise an event to store into an event store.
10. Event Object should be built in the Aggregate after logic.
11. Now, publish this event using AggregateLifecycle.apply().
12. We need to update the store of the Aggregate for all the commands and events.
13. We need to create the EventHandler to handle the event published to the event store and annotate it with @EventHandler.
14. So, here we will save the payload to the repository and Database.
